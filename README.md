# Developing-Numerical-Algorithms-for-Partial-Differential-Equations-Using-Uniform-Meshes
This project studied Gradient and Hessian operators on uniform meshes, approximated via polynomial preserving recovery. A systematic finite difference scheme adaptable to structured and unstructured meshes was proposed, with accuracy analyzed by Taylor expansion and validated through numerical experiments.
